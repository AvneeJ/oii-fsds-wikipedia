    "Today we will make use of the `wiki-time-plots.py` script. This has been pushed now to the oii-fsds-wikipedia repository. You should be able to fetch it to your repo the same way that you fetched the files for the previous lab. \n",

    "With your downloaded DataFrames, use these scripts in order to view the edit history over time. By default this script will simply view a count of edit history. It will need further processing if you wish to choose another column. For your presentation on Monday, please consider what word, phrase, or feature of the revisions you wish to show over time. You will also need to consider how you can plot two distributions. The moving average code will plot the revisions and the moving average. You can use this to help understand how to plot to separate revisions. \n",
